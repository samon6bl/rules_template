# Cline's Memory Bank - Project Brief

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive rules template for AI coding assistants (Cursor, CLINE, RooCode, Windsurf) that provides structured workflows and documentation patterns for software development projects.

## Core Purpose
To establish a universal framework for AI-assisted coding that:
- Ensures consistent quality across different AI coding platforms
- Provides systematic workflows for planning, implementation, and debugging
- Maintains comprehensive project documentation and context
- Enables cross-platform compatibility and context sharing

## Problems This Project Solves
1. **Inconsistent AI Assistant Behavior**: Different AI coding assistants have varying approaches to problem-solving
2. **Lack of Project Context**: AI assistants often lose context between sessions or across different tools
3. **Missing Documentation Standards**: Many projects lack proper documentation structure for AI-assisted development
4. **Inefficient Token Usage**: No optimized modes for different types of tasks

## Core Requirements
1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Must work with Cursor, CLINE, RooCode, and Windsurf
2. **Memory Persistence**: Maintain project context across sessions and platforms
3. **Workflow Standardization**: Provide consistent planning, implementation, and debugging workflows
4. **Documentation Integration**: Automatically update project documentation
5. **Token Optimization**: Include lean modes for different task types

## Goals
1. Create a universal rules template that standardizes AI-assisted development
2. Establish a memory bank system for persistent project context
3. Provide systematic workflows based on software engineering best practices
4. Enable seamless switching between different AI coding assistants
5. Reduce token usage while maintaining functionality

## Success Criteria
- Successfully used across multiple AI coding platforms
- Maintains consistent project documentation
- Reduces development time through standardized workflows
- Provides clear context for AI assistants
- Enables effective collaboration between human developers and AI assistants
