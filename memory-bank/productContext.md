# Product Context - AI Coding Rules Template

## Why This Product Exists

### The Problem Space
AI coding assistants have become essential tools in modern software development, but they suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Different AI assistants (Cursor, CLINE, RooCode, Windsurf) have varying approaches to problem-solving, leading to inconsistent code quality and development patterns.

2. **Context Loss**: AI assistants lose project context between sessions, requiring developers to repeatedly explain project structure, requirements, and previous decisions.

3. **Lack of Standardization**: No unified framework exists for AI-assisted development workflows, leading to ad-hoc approaches that vary between projects and teams.

4. **Token Inefficiency**: AI assistants often use excessive tokens for simple tasks due to lack of optimized modes for different types of work.

### Market Need
The software development industry needs a standardized framework that:
- Provides consistent AI assistant behavior across platforms
- Maintains persistent project context
- Offers systematic workflows for different development phases
- Optimizes token usage while maintaining functionality

## How It Should Work

### Core Functionality
1. **Cross-Platform Rules**: Universal rule system that works identically across Cursor, CLINE, RooCode, and Windsurf
2. **Memory Bank System**: Persistent documentation that serves as project context for AI assistants
3. **Workflow Standardization**: Systematic approaches for planning, implementation, and debugging
4. **Token Optimization**: Specialized modes for different task types to minimize token usage

### User Experience Goals

#### For Developers
- **Seamless Integration**: Easy setup across different AI coding platforms
- **Consistent Quality**: Predictable AI assistant behavior regardless of platform
- **Context Preservation**: No need to repeatedly explain project details
- **Efficient Workflows**: Streamlined development processes

#### For Teams
- **Standardized Processes**: Consistent development patterns across team members
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Shared project context and documentation
- **Reduced Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand project structure
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in best practices and error prevention

#### For Organizations
- **Platform Flexibility**: Ability to switch between AI coding assistants without losing context
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent project documentation across all projects
- **Development Efficiency**: Reduced development time through standardized workflows
- **Risk Mitigation**: Built-in error documentation and lessons learned system

## Key Features
