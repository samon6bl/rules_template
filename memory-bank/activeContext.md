# Active Context - AI Coding Rules Template

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Task: Memory Bank Initialization
**Status**: In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-09-10  
**Expected Completion**: 2025-09-10  

I am currently initializing the Memory Bank for the AI Coding Rules Template project. This involves creating the core memory files that will serve as persistent context for AI assistants working on this project.

### Current Sub-task: Creating Core Memory Files
**Status**: 80% Complete  
**Files Created**: 4/6  
**Remaining**: 2 files

#### Completed Files:
1. ‚úÖ **projectbrief.md** - Project overview, purpose, and goals
2. ‚úÖ **productContext.md** - Why the product exists and how it should work
3. ‚úÖ **systemPatterns.md** - System architecture and design patterns
4. ‚úÖ **techContext.md** - Technologies, setup, and technical decisions

#### Remaining Files:
1. üîÑ **activeContext.md** - Current work focus (this file)
2. ‚è≥ **progress.md** - What works and what's left to build

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Memory Bank Structure
**Decision**: Following the hierarchical structure specified in Memory Bank.md
**Rationale**: Provides clear context flow from high-level requirements to implementation details
**Impact**: Ensures consistent documentation pattern across all projects using this template

### 2. Content Depth
**Decision**: Create comprehensive but concise documentation
**Rationale**: Balance between providing sufficient context and avoiding information overload
**Impact**: Memory files are informative but not overwhelming for AI assistants

### 3. Cross-Reference Strategy
**Decision**: Include references to existing project documentation
**Rationale**: Leverage existing project knowledge while maintaining Memory Bank independence
**Impact**: Creates cohesive documentation ecosystem

## Recent Changes

### 1. Memory Bank Directory Created
- **When**: 2025-09-10
- **What**: Established `memory-bank/` directory structure
- **Why**: Centralized location for AI assistant context

### 2. Core Files Initialized
- **When**: 2025-09-10
- **What**: Created 4 of 6 core memory files
- **Why**: Establish foundational context for AI assistants

### 3. Documentation Standards Applied
- **When**: 2025-09-10
- **What**: Applied consistent formatting and structure
- **Why**: Ensure readability and maintainability

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Complete activeContext.md** - Finish documenting current work focus
2. **Create progress.md** - Document what works and remaining tasks
3. **Review and validate** - Ensure all memory files are consistent

### Short-term (Next session)
1. **Test Memory Bank** - Verify AI assistants can access and use the context
2. **Update existing documentation** - Sync with docs/ directory files
3. **Create example usage** - Demonstrate how to use the Memory Bank

### Medium-term (Next few sessions)
1. **Refine content** - Based on actual usage feedback
2. **Add optional files** - Literature surveys, RFCs as needed
3. **Optimize structure** - Improve based on practical experience

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Documentation Patterns
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Information flows from general to specific
- **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized headers and sections
- **Cross-References**: Links between related concepts and files
- **Actionable Content**: Clear next steps and decision rationale

### AI Assistant Preferences
- **Context First**: Provide background before specific instructions
- **Examples Included**: Show practical applications of concepts
- **Decision Rationale**: Explain why choices were made
- **Error Prevention**: Include common pitfalls and solutions

### Project-Specific Insights
- **Template Nature**: This is a meta-project for creating other projects
- **Cross-Platform Focus**: Must work across multiple AI coding platforms
- **Documentation-Centric**: Heavy emphasis on maintaining context
- **Workflow-Driven**: Structured approaches for different task types

## Current Blockers and Challenges

### 1. File Completeness
**Issue**: 2 of 6 core memory files still need creation
**Impact**: Incomplete context for AI assistants
**Resolution**: Complete remaining files in current session

### 2. Integration Testing
**Issue**: Haven't tested Memory Bank with actual AI assistants
**Impact**: Uncertain if context is properly accessible
**Resolution**: Test with available AI platforms after completion

### 3. Synchronization with Existing Docs
**Issue**: Memory Bank and docs/ directory may become out of sync
**Impact**: Potential confusion between AI context and project documentation
**Resolution**: Establish synchronization protocol and regular update schedule

## Session Notes

### Current Session (2025-09-10)
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Achievements**: 
- Created memory-bank/ directory structure
- Completed 4 of 6 core memory files
- Established consistent documentation patterns

**Key Insights**:
- Memory Bank structure maps well to existing project documentation
- Cross-platform compatibility requires careful consideration
- Hierarchical approach provides clear context flow

**Next Actions**:
- Complete remaining 2 memory files
- Test integration with AI assistants
- Document usage patterns and best practices
